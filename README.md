# Red Color Image Detection using OpenCV, Matplotlib, and NumPy

# DESCRIPTION:
This project aimed to detect and highlight red-colored objects in images using Python libraries such as OpenCV, Matplotlib, and NumPy. The project was designed to provide foundational knowledge of image processing techniques and introduce students to practical applications of Python in computer vision.

# CHALLENGES AND EFFECTIVENESS:
While the project efficiently detected red objects in most images, it faced challenges when multiple red-colored objects were present. This was likely due to overlapping objects or varying shades of red that made segmentation difficult. However, the detection was robust in scenarios where objects were distinct, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm in controlled conditions.

# CONCLUSION:
This project served as an academic exercise to introduce students to key technologies in Python, particularly in the field of image processing. It provided hands-on experience with OpenCV, Matplotlib, and NumPy, laying the groundwork for more advanced exploration of computer vision and machine learning. Future iterations could explore improvements in object segmentation and handling varying color intensities.
